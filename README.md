Silly app you can use to manage songs. You can download songs from youtube, or import from disk, and then create playlists with them. You can then export the playlists as directories containing shortcuts to the songs.
Probably buggy, definentely messy.

Requires ffmpeg and yt-dlp if you want to download songs. Set the paths to them in the preferences.
